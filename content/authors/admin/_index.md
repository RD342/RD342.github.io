I am a PhD student specializing in Mathematics. My research focus is on bio-inspired collective behavior modelling. As an interdisciplinary field, I am supervised by Prof. Stuart Townley and Dr Saptarshi Das from the Department of Mathematics and Prof. Alex Thornton from the Department of Ecology.

I am interested in swarm intelligence, the collective behavior of animals, meta-heuristic algorithm and modelling. 

ALGORITHMIC SKILLS: 
Familiar with supervised learning such as support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbour algorithm, decision trees, and clustering algorithms such as Hierarchical clustering, k-Means clustering.  
Proficient in linear regression, logistic regression, naive Bayes, Neural Networks and Hidden Markov Models.
